# Hi! I'm Kiera.

I'm a 19-year-old student from New Jersey.

I like programming, linguistics, urban planning, and robotics.

Welcome! This website is where I keep my writing and project showcases—go take a look!

If, for some reason, you're interested in hiring me, I have also posted my <a href="/resume">resume</a>.
